        <p>I have always been tall, decidedly tall.
           Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height.
           Starting at a young age, I would ask countless questions, from
           “How heavy is the Earth?” to “Where does rain come from?”
           My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly
           defined me as a person and as a student. Therefore, it is not
           surprising that I became transfixed the first time I played
           20Q (the
           <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/20Q_red_%28Radica%29_front.jpg" target=_blankelectroniversion> of Twenty Questions).
           Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking.
           The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in
           me a unique interest in 20Q. This interest would later reveal valuable
           character traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life</p>

       <p>After my introduction to 20Q, I began to play Twenty Questions (the traditional parlor game) and became
          determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the artificial intelligence. At first I was mediocre. However,
          through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy,
          and time, I became more effective. I discovered the “secrets” to success: practice and perseverance.</p>
